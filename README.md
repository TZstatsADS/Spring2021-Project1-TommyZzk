Term: Spring 2021

+ Projec title:  Why did Hillary Clinton fail in 2016

+ Project summary: The result of 2016 election is a shock to many people, and we don't know how could Hillary lost that battle. Some people give their opinion that the loss is due to the lack of voting interest of Black people, the lost confident to Democratic Party at Great Lake region as well as the person issue of Hillary Clinton exposed by the media and etc. This project will decompose these factors to see are these critics telling the truth. What happened exactly.
